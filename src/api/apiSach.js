      "A poor puppeteer named Geppetto is given a slab of wood by a neighbouring carpenter, who becomes fearful of the block when he hears a cry coming from it. Geppetto works hard to carve a puppet, who he lovingly names Pinocchio. Even though the puppet has not been fully finished, he already goes about creating trouble for Geppetto. When Pinocchio is seen running out of Geppettoâ€™s house by the authorities, they instantly assume the puppet is being ill-treated, and imprison Geppetto",
